# Overview of the Project

The project consists of two separate programs:

## Data Analysis Program

The program is responsible for determination of the relationship between user features and sensor data received from subjects

## GUI (Graphical User Interface)

The simple app is responsible for user interaction with user authorization and personalization of the sensor data per user.
The app includes graph to show the received data and functions to control Posture Monitoring
This allows the user to determine posture dynamics throughout the experiments

1. Please do not clone the entire repository. Please clone particular program as they contain the file paths relative to
each separate program
2. The requirements for each of the program will be updated later on
